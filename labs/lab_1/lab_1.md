Targets of this class:
1. Introduction to the C#/C++ framework example codes: wpfTest2020
2. How to create C++/winRT applications
3. Cache line and multithreads performance


Please notice that git operation GUI in VS 2019 Community Preview 
is quite different from that in VS 2019 Community. In the next version
of VS, say VS 2021, Microsoft may thoroughly changed the git GUI.
But this is only a guessing, so we **strongly suggest** using git command line
in powershell of windows for your daily git operations. And that will 
also help you a lot be familiar with git commands.
